                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p> The image on the left or above is of a google spreadsheet that i crated for my 2015 algebra class. The purpose of the project was to teach us students about how to make a budget plan for possible careers based on a personality test. The content on the spreadsheet ranges from taxes to phone bills to car insurance. The main point we were to grasp from the project is that life right out of college really pushes right into the real world and how you are recoginzed as an adult. I myself gathered this very quickly because of the new additions we have to make every time we came to class. By the end of the project i had a full grasp on what to expect after high school and college.  </p>
