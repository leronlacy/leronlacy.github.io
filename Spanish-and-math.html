                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>The image above or to the left is of a calavera ,or a skull in English, which i painted for my Spanish project as a junior. For the project we had to paint a skull for day of the dead. One side was to represent my views of day of the dead and the other was to represent the Hispanic views of day of the dead. We had  include different images that were commonly used to celebrate day of the dead. Such as spirits and flowers.My partner and I decided to paint the side with our views white and the other side with the Hispanic views black. When researching the Hispanic views we saw the spirits never leaving as a bad thing because of how growing up we was spirits as evil. For our side we painted angles and heaven because that is how we viewed the after life. On the other side we painted ghosts and a cemetery where it is celebrated.   </p>
