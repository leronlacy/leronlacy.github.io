                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>The images to the left or above is of a shoe that I painted for my sophomore english and history project.To complete the goal of the project I had to select a victim of the holocaust and create a memorial to his/or her life. The  purpose was to understand how many people died in the holocaust represented by the massive amount of shoes that where left in auschwitz germany.The person I selected was Deen,he was 17 years old and went to auschwitz with his family.Very little was known about Deen other than his first name so I had to make some characteristics for him, such as his likes and dislikes.I chose to have him like baseball,music, and work as a mechanic. He was of German nationality. </p>
