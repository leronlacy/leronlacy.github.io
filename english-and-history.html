                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>The image to the left or above is of a shoe that I painted for my sophomore english and history project.To complete the goal of the project I had to select a victim of the holocaust and create a memorial to his/or her life. The  purpose was to understand how many people died in the holocaust represented by the massive amount of shoes that where left in auschwitz germany.The person I selected was Deen,he was 17 years old and went to auschwitz with his family.Very little was known about Deen other than his first name so I had to make some characteristics for him, such as his likes and dislikes.I chose to have him like baseball,music, and work as a mechanic. He was of German nationality. </p>

                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>For the pixelated life project I made a small scale version of the Destiny symbol and the traveler a character in the video game. Destiny is a video game that released to the public on September 9th 2014, I did not purchase the game until december 2015. In spite of that I still to this day play countless amounts of hours every week. I choose to make two of the most memorable and iconic symbols of the game because it gave me connections with some of the community’s best players and other companies, even giving me early access to other games and betas. It gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself. It’s important to me because it is something that I will never forget. My classmates and I used piskel to create the animations, I myself used various images to get the right size and shape of the two symbols.
